                                EMPLOYEE ATTRITION
=============================================================================================================
=============================================================================================================
The key to success in any organization is attracting and retaining top talent. Major task of HR analyst at
any organization is to determine which factors keep employees at the organization and which prompt
others to leave. They need to know what factors can be changed to prevent the loss of good people.
This problem is there in all the organizations, but that involve lots of analysis to pinpoint the issues, I
have used the data from Kaggle to find some of the reasons for the attrition.
Attrition is a big problem of all the organization, sometime people leave their current job, when they are
not satisfied with their work or salary or promotion or could be due to some other reason. Human
Resource Team collect different data from employees to identify the reasons for attrition.
This data is created by IBM data scientist, and it have several attributes that can help to identify the
attrition reasons. Some of the important fields are Business Travel, Department, Distance from Home,
Employment satisfaction, Hourly Rate, Job Involvement, Monthly Income, Overtime, Performance
Rating, Salary hike, Years Since Last promotion etc.
I am planning to do exploratory data analysis to do the analysis on the attributes, I will also try to find
the relationship between attributes and attrition field.
Will plan to fit few models, that can predict an employee if he/she will be having attrition.
