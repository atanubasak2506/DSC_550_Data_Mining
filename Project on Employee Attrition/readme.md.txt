            Project: Employee Attrition 

=============================================================
=============================================================
Attrition is a big problem of all the organization, sometime people leave their current job, when they are Not satisfied with their work, salary, promotion or could be due to another reason. The Human Resource Team collects different data from employees to identify the reasons for attrition. This data is created by IBM data scientist, and it have several attributes that can help to identify the reasons for attrition. Some of the important fields are Business Travel, Department, Distance from Home, Employment satisfaction, Hourly Rate, Job Involvement, Monthly Income, Overtime, Performance Rating, Salary hike, Years Since Last promotion etc. 

I did some exploratory data analysis to do the analysis on the attributes and tried to find the relationship between attributes and attrition field. I fit a few models, that can predict an employee if he/she will be having attrition. 

Software Used : Python (Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn), Jupyter Notebook
